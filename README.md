# visual_pathping_multiendpoint
This is a simple python script to use pathping to make an interactive graph with pyviz. 
  Load csv with endpoints
  Specify file to save html to
  Change -q value as needed
  Change display values on network graph as needed.

Note if there are duplicate paths x->y x-y I didn't set it to have multiple edges you could have this but for troubleshooting layer 3/ latency shouldn't be that big of a deal.
